# WADE - Project for Web Application Development

## Team: SuperMarIo - Ioana-Malina Pinzariu & Maria-Ecaterina Olariu

## Project: 
Develop an extensible microservice-based system able to perform processing tasks such as browsing, smart faceted searching & filtering, etc. Adopting both deep learning (or machine learning) techniques – for example, a public REST API like DeepDetect – and semantic Web technologies, the platform will be able to generate various visualizations (e.g., semantic zoom), correlations, classifications, and recommendations exposed via a SPARQL endpoint. Also, a comparison study will be provided to explain the obtained results. Additional info: An Introduction to Data Visualization.
